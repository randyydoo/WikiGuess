The objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter and 10 feet (3.048 m) high mounted to a backboard at each end of the court. The game is played under the rules of the National Basketball Association (NBA).  The game is officiated by two referees. One referee is positioned on the side of the court in the key, and the other is positioned at halfcourt. The referees call fouls, determine shot clock violations, and check the ball for legal and illegal bounces.  The ball is normally a spherical inflated rubber ball, but special leather balls are used in the game of streetball. The ball is out of bounds when it touches the ground or anything else outside the court, including the spectator seating.  A team can score by shooting the ball through the basket mounted on the backboard, or by throwing the ball into the basket from the playing area. The ball can be advanced on the court by bouncing it off the floor (this is called a dribble), passing it to a teammate, or shooting it. A team can also score by stealing the ball from an opposing team. When a team commits a foul, the other team is awarded a free throw.  The game is divided into four 12-minute quarters. The clock stops when the ball is not in play. Timeouts can be called by either team. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.

The batter can also choose to let the ball go by and not hit it. If the batter does hit the ball, he can run to first base. If the ball is hit into play and the fielder touches the ball before the runner gets to first base, the runner is out. If the fielder throws the ball to the first baseman before the runner can get back to the base, the runner is out.  If the batter gets a hit, he can try to run to second base. If the fielder throws the ball to the second baseman before the runner can get to second base, the runner is out. If the fielder throws the ball to the shortstop before the runner can get to second base, the runner is out. If the ball is hit out of play, the batter is out.  If the batter gets a hit and the ball is hit over the fence, the batter is automatically out and the other runners can try to score a point. If the fielder throws the ball to the catcher before any of the runners can get to home plate, the runner trying to score a point is out. If the catcher catches the ball, the runner trying to score a point is out.  If the batter gets a hit and the ball is hit to the shortstop, the shortstop can throw the ball to the first baseman to get the runner out.

A baseman tries to catch the ball or to prevent the batter from reaching first base. The team at bat tries to score runs by having the batter hit the ball and then running to the next base before the fielding team catches the ball. The team in the field tries to put the ball in play and then catch the ball to record an out.  There are many different ways to play baseball, depending on the team\'s strengths and the opposing team\'s weaknesses. The most common strategy is to play small ball, which involves trying to get on base with singles and doubles, and then advancing runners with sacrifice flies or bunts. Another common strategy is to take advantage of the hitters\' power by playing for home runs.  Some teams try to put pressure on the opposing team by stealing bases. Stealing bases can be risky, because if the runner is caught stealing, the team risks an out. However, if the runner is successful in stealing a base, it can put the opposing team in a difficult position, because they have to make a play at second base, and that can lead to a run.  When a team is behind in the game, they may use a sacrifice bunt or a sacrifice fly to move a runner from third base to home plate, which is called a "squeeze play". This can be a risky strategy, because if the hitter fails to get a hit, the team may lose a run.  There are also defensive strategies that can be used to get the opposing team out. One strategy is to play "small ball", which involves playing for ground balls that can be easily fielded and turned into an out. Another strategy is to use a "shift", which is when the shortstop and third baseman move closer to the first base side of the diamond to try and catch a batted ball. This can be effective against a left-handed hitter, because they are likely to hit the ball to the left side of the field.  When a team is in the lead, they may use a "closer" to protect the lead. A closer is a relief pitcher who is brought into the game in the later innings, typically the ninth inning, to shut down the opposing team and protect the lead. A closer usually has a fastball that can reach 100 miles per hour, and they are often used to get the final out of the game.'}, {'Sport': 'Baseball', 'Subsection': 'History', 'Text': '  Baseball has a long and rich history.

Golf course designers must take into account a variety of factors when designing a course, including the terrain, the climate, and the availability of water. They must also consider the needs of the players, such as the distance of the holes and the amount of OB (out-of-bounds).  Golf courses are typically owned and operated by golf clubs or private companies.

The object is to hit the ball into the hole with as few strokes as possible. A player who completes the hole with fewer strokes than the par score is said to have made a "birdie", while a player who takes more strokes than the par score is said to have made a "bogey". A score of one under par is called an "eagle", and a score of two under par is called a "double eagle".  A player must keep their ball "in play" by striking it "in bounds" and not out of bounds, and by not hitting it into a water hazard or out of bounds. If a player\'s ball goes out of bounds, or into a water hazard, they must drop a new ball where their last ball left the course, and take a one-stroke penalty. If a player hits two balls into the same water hazard, they must take a two-stroke penalty.  After hitting their ball, a player must then walk to where their ball is lying and decide what to do with it. There are four options:  The player can "putt" the ball into the hole by striking it with a putter and rolling it along the ground. This is the slowest method and is usually used when the ball is close to the hole.  The player can "chip" the ball using a chip shot. This is a short shot made with a wedge that is designed to make the ball roll a short distance after landing.  The player can "bounce" the ball using a bounce shot. This is a short shot made with a lofted club that is designed to make the ball bounce a short distance after landing.  The player can "drive" the ball using a drive shot. This is a long shot made with a wood or iron that is designed to make the ball travel a long distance.'}, {'Sport': 'Golf', 'Subsection': 'Rules and regulations', 'Text': "  Most professional golf events are governed by the rules of golf set by the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews and the United States Golf Association (USGA). The rules are designed to provide a fair contest and consistent playing conditions.  Many of the rules are common to other sports, but golf has several unique rules. The most important rules concern the taking of relief, the use of golf clubs, and the scoring of strokes.  One of the unique aspects of golf is the ability to take relief from various conditions that might affect the play of the ball. If a player's ball is in a hazard, for example, he or she may take relief under a rule called taking relief. There are many other types of relief, such as relief from abnormal ground conditions and relief from interference by other objects.  Players are allowed to use any of the 14 clubs in their bag, but they are not allowed to touch the ground with the club other than the putter before striking the ball. This is intended to prevent players from unfairly improving their lie.  The score of a hole is the number of strokes taken to complete the hole, plus any penalties incurred. The golfer with the lowest score at the end of the round is the winner. In match play, the player with the lowest score on a hole wins the hole. If both players have the same score, the hole is said to be halved."}, {'Sport': 'Golf', 'Subsection': 'Equipment', 'Text': "  Golf clubs are the most important piece of equipment for a golfer.

The golfer will also carry a sand wedge and a putter. Wedges and putters can be custom-fitted to the individual golfer.   There are many different types of golf clubs on the market, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. The driver is the club that is used to hit the ball the farthest down the fairway. Drivers are typically made of titanium, and they have a large club head that is designed to make the ball go a long way. The 3-wood is a club that is designed to hit the ball farther than a traditional wood club, and it is typically used when the ball is near the green. The 5-wood and the 7-wood are similar to the 3-wood, but they have a smaller club head. The 3-hybrid is a club that is designed to replace the 3-iron, and it is typically used when the ball is near the green. The 4-iron, the 5-iron, the 6-iron, and the 7-iron are all clubs that are designed to hit the ball farther than traditional irons.

There are many different techniques, but all strokes fall into three basic categories: full swing, chip, and putt.   The full swing is the most important stroke in golf. It is used to hit the ball the farthest, and is used for both driving and iron shots. The goal of the full swing is to hit the ball in the middle of the clubface and make clean contact with the ball. To do this, the golfer should keep their arms and body connected, and make a smooth swinging motion.  The chip is a short, high-lofted stroke that is used to get the ball over obstacles and onto the green. The goal of the chip is to make contact with the ball before the ground, and to hit the ball as high as possible. This can be done by making a downward swinging motion and hitting the ball before the ground.  The putt is the most important stroke on the green. It is used to get the ball into the hole in as few strokes as possible. The goal of the putt is to make a smooth, pendulum-like swinging motion and hit the ball in the middle of the clubface.

It is a relatively common injury in people who participate in sports that require a lot of swinging motions, such as tennis, golf, and fencing.  Tennis players can also sprain their ankles, as they often change direction quickly when playing. Ankle sprains can be very painful and often require a player to wear a brace and to avoid bearing weight on the ankle for a period of time.  In rare cases, tennis players can also suffer from rotator cuff tears, a tear in the rotator cuff muscles and tendons. This injury can be very painful and can make it difficult to raise the arm.'}, {'Sport': 'Tennis', 'Subsection': 'In popular culture', 'Text': '   In popular culture "Tennis" has appeared in a number of films, television shows, and video games.

The aim of the game is to score more runs than the other team. A run is scored when a player from the batting team safely crosses home plate after touching all four bases.  Bases are 90 feet apart, and are marked by white rubber cones or metal spikes. A player must touch first base, then second base, third base, and finally home plate in order to score a run.  The pitcher, who stands on the mound in the middle of the diamond, throws the ball towards the catcher, who is positioned behind home plate. The catcher tries to catch the ball and put out the batter, or stop the ball from getting to the plate so that the batter cannot score.  There are three ways a player can be put out:  1. The batter can be hit by a pitched ball, which is called a strikeout.  2. The batter can hit the ball and the fielder can catch it before it touches the ground, which is called a out.  3. The batter can run to first base, but the fielder can throw the ball to the first baseman before the batter reaches the base, which is called a tag out.  There are also several ways a player can be safe:  1. The batter can hit the ball and the fielder can't catch it, which is called a hit.  2. The batter can run to first base and the fielder can't throw the ball to the first baseman in time, which is called a base hit.  3. The batter can run to second base, third base, or home plate and the fielder can't throw the ball to the player who is trying to get him out, which is called a force out.  If the ball is hit into the stands, the batter is awarded a home run and all players on base automatically score.  The game is divided into innings. An inning is over when the other team has had a turn at bat and either succeeded in getting three outs, or the team with the most players on base cannot hit the ball into play and the inning automatically ends.  There are nine players in the batting order, and the batting order stays the same throughout the game. The player who is first in the batting order is the leadoff batter, and the player who is last in the batting order is the cleanup hitter.  The team at bat tries to score as many runs as possible. The team in the field tries to get the other team out. There are three ways to get an out: by striking the batter out, catching the ball before it hits the ground, or throwing the ball to the player who is trying to get the batter out before the batter reaches a base.  There are three ways to score a run: by the batter hitting the ball and the fielder not catching it, by the batter running to first base and the fielder not catching the ball, or by the batter running to second base, third base, or home plate and the fielder not catching the ball.  The game is over when one team has scored more runs than the other team."}, {'Sport': 'Baseball', 'Subsection': 'Strategy', 'Text': "  Strategy in baseball revolves around the batting order, the use of defensive shifts, and managing innings.  The batting order is important because it affects the order of the hitters' chances to get on base and to score runs. The first batter in the order is typically the best hitter on the team, and the order typically goes from the best hitter to the worst. Managers often try to get the best hitters in the lineup as many times as possible.  Defensive shifts are used to try to get an advantage against the batter. The shortstop and third baseman may line up on the right side of the infield when the batter is a right-handed hitter, for example. This puts more fielders on the right side of the diamond to catch the ball if it is hit to the right side.  Inning management is important because the batting team only has a certain number of chances to score runs. The manager may try to save the best hitters for the later innings, when the team is closer to scoring. The manager may also try to use relief pitchers to get the most important outs."}, {'Sport': 'Baseball', 'Subsection': 'History', 'Text': "  Baseball's history is a long and storied one, with the game having been played continuously since the mid-19th century.

The playing field is rectangular and consists of two macadamized base paths, 90 feet apart, between which the players run. The distance from home plate to first base is 90 feet, and the distance from first to second base is also 90 feet. The playing field has four markers, called bases, one at each corner. The bases are arranged in a diamond, and are typically white.  The pitcher\'s mound is located in the center of the diamond.

There are many different ways to swing a golf club, and the best swing for you depends on your own physical abilities and playing style. However, there are some basic principles that all golf swings share.  The golf swing begins with the club head moving back away from the ball. At the same time, the body turns to the left. As the club head begins to come forward, the body turns back to the right. The club head should reach the ball just as the body returns to its original position.  There are many different aspects of the golf swing that can be adjusted to fit your own playing style. However, there are four basic elements that you should always keep in mind: tempo, backswing, downswing, and follow-through.  Tempo is the speed of your swing. It is important to maintain a consistent tempo throughout your swing. A good way to practice finding the right tempo is to use a metronome.  The backswing is the part of the swing where the club head moves back away from the ball. It is important to keep the backswing slow and smooth, without any sudden motions. Picking up the speed too quickly will cause you to lose control of the club head.  The downswing is the part of the swing where the club head moves forward and hits the ball. It is important to pick up the speed gradually, so that you have enough power to hit the ball cleanly.  The follow-through is the part of the swing where the club head continues moving forward after hitting the ball. It is important to keep your arms and body loose and relaxed during the follow-through.'}, {'Sport': 'Golf', 'Subsection': 'Rules and regulations', 'Text': "  There are many rules in golf, and breaking them can lead to strokes added to players' scores.

The game is governed by the Rules of Golf, which are published by the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews. The Rules cover every conceivable aspect of the game, from the dimensions of the holes to the clothes that players are allowed to wear.  Players are allowed a maximum of 14 club members in their bag. They are also allowed to use a caddie, who can help with club selection and offer advice on the best way to play the course.  Players are allowed to take a maximum of 40 seconds to hit a ball, and must play the ball as it lies. If a player moves a ball accidentally, they must place it back where it was before and incur a penalty stroke.  If a player's ball comes to rest in a water hazard, they are allowed to take a drop from the hazard, or they can play another ball from the spot where their original ball was last played. If a player's ball is lost or out of bounds, they can take a drop from a designated spot, or they can replay the shot.  Players can incur penalties for a variety of reasons, including hitting the ball out of bounds, hitting the ball into water, or taking too long to hit the ball. The most common penalty is one stroke, but players can also be penalized with a loss of hole, meaning they must complete the hole with a higher score than they started with."}, {'Sport': 'Golf', 'Subsection': 'Equipment', 'Text': '  Golf clubs can be made of wood, metal or composite materials.
